# qperf_cli

**qperf_cli** is a command-line tool to quickly calculate the performance of Bible Quizzers on all question types across multiple rounds. It processes `.csv` logs generated by QuizMachine along with corresponding `.rtf` question sets, providing a detailed performance analysis of individual quizzers.

**A graphical version is available** with all the same functionality [here](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperformance)

## Features

- Analyzes quizzer performance for each question type.
- Tracks how often each quizzer:
  - Attempts each type of question.
  - Answers each type correctly.
  - Attempts and answers bonus questions.
- Outputs results in CSV format, which can be easily imported into spreadsheet software like Excel.

## Getting Started

### Downloading Compiled Builds

Pre-compiled builds of **qperf_cli** are available for:

- **Windows PCs** (x86, Intel/AMD CPUs)
- **Linux PCs** (x86, Intel/AMD CPUs)

You can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_cli/releases) section of this repository.

> **Note:**  
> The vast majority of Windows PCs use Intel or AMD CPUs compatible with this program. If you're unsure, try running the Windows build first.

For other systems (e.g., macOS or ARM-based devices), you will need to build the program from source.

### Running the Program

1. **Prepare your input files**:
   - A `.csv` file generated by QuizMachine, logging multiple rounds.
   - One or more `.rtf` question sets.
   - Multiple question sets may be in a single file or multiple.
   - Set numbers in `.rtf` files MUST match the round numbers used in QuizMachine.
  

2. **Run the program** in the terminal:
   ```bash
   ./qperf /path/to/questions /path/to/logs.csv
   ```
   (optional) If all your questions are in one `.rtf` file, then you may use the path to the specific file instead of the folder.

3. **Pipe output to a CSV file** (optional):
   ```bash
   ./qperf /path/to/questions /path/to/logs.csv > output.csv
   ```

### Example

```bash
./qperf quiz_sets/ event_logs.csv > performance_report.csv
```

This generates `performance_report.csv`, containing detailed quizzer statistics.

## Building From Source

If the pre-compiled binaries don't work on your machine, or you're using a platform like macOS or ARM-based devices, you can build `qperf_cli` from source.

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) must be installed on your system.

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_cli.git
   cd qperf_cli
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the executable** from the `target/release` directory:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/qperf /path/to/questions /path/to/logs.csv
   ```
