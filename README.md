# qperformance

**qperformance** is a Rust terminal application designed for organizers of Bible Quizzing events. It processes `.csv` logs generated by QuizMachine along with corresponding `.rtf` question sets, providing a detailed performance analysis of individual quizzers.

## Features

- Analyzes quizzer performance for each question type.
- Tracks how often each quizzer:
  - Attempts each type of question.
  - Answers each type correctly.
  - Attempts and answers bonus questions.
- Outputs results in CSV format, which can be easily imported into spreadsheet software like Excel.

## Getting Started

### Downloading Compiled Builds

Pre-compiled builds of **qperformance** are available for:

- **Windows PCs** (x86, Intel/AMD CPUs)
- **Linux PCs** (x86, Intel/AMD CPUs)

You can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperformance/releases) section of this repository.

> **Note:**  
> The vast majority of Windows PCs use Intel or AMD CPUs compatible with this program. If you're unsure, try running the Windows build first.

For other systems (e.g., macOS or ARM-based devices), you will need to build the program from source.

### Running the Program

1. **Prepare your input files**:
   - A `.csv` file generated by QuizMachine, logging multiple rounds.
   - A folder containing `.rtf` question sets corresponding to each round.

2. **Run the program** in the terminal:
   ```bash
   ./qperformance /path/to/questions /path/to/logs.csv
   ```

3. **Pipe output to a CSV file** (optional):
   ```bash
   ./qperformance /path/to/questions /path/to/logs.csv > output.csv
   ```

### Example

```bash
./qperformance quiz_sets/ event_logs.csv > performance_report.csv
```

This generates `performance_report.csv`, containing detailed quizzer statistics.

## Building From Source

If the pre-compiled binaries don't work on your machine, or you're using a platform like macOS or ARM-based devices, you can build `qperformance` from source.

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) must be installed on your system.

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbwrush/qperformance.git
   cd qperformance
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the executable** from the `target/release` directory:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/qperformance /path/to/questions /path/to/logs.csv
   ```
